# Weird-Weather-Effects
A rimworld mod that adds a bunch of weather effects to the game

# Added Effects

### Razor Grass
While this is active, being on top of grass in the map damages pawns with very small bleeds. They are small and easily tended. But don't watch out and your pawns might bleed to death.

### Termites
A horde of thermites ravages the map, They will damage all wood and wood based structures by 90% of their max HP. Get the constructors repairing so it's all fixed for the next time.

### Hurricane
A large hurricane will blow across. It will tear of roofs from your buildings quite quickly.

### Fire rain
Fire will rain from the sky. If you have build structures from wood I sincerely hope you have enough firefighters. For some reason roofs seem to be built fireproof.

### Godly jelly
After a horrible event a rain of godly jelly might appear. The gods will pour insect jelly all over your map. Be sure to have a space to store it though.

### Blizzard
It's snowing so hard your pawns cannot even see 3 meters away. Hitting targets will be pure luck and moving is very hard.

### Mountain Poisoning
The mountains have started to emit some sort of gas that quickly gives your pawns mountain poisoning. Getting Outside seems to be the only real way to cure it and even that takes a while.

### Genderfluid Rain
Also known as HRainT, if a pawn walks through it they will transition. After too much continuous exposure they will be permanently switched to the other sex. If a pawn is transitioned but not transgender they will be very sad. The only known way to transition back is by repeated exposure to the rain, but that might take a while.
